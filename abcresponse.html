<h1>We wrote this email in response to the ABC story linked <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-08/bike-death-raises-safety-questions-eyre-highway/100055786">here</a>.</h1>

<p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p>I am very disappointed and upset that your article about the tragic death of my brother Leif focussed more on rider safety than the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>There was very little reference to his actual trip and the cause for his journey - that being climate action and environmental protection - and for you to focus the story on rider safety implies that Leif himself was in the wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is simply false and an outrageous claim. The truck driver has already been charged with an account of dangerous driving, which speaks for itself in who was really at fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, the focus of this tragedy should not be whether cyclists should be allowed on roads, but Leif&rsquo;s drive and passion for making the world a better place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were ever going to frame this article about rider safety, it should have been regarding the responsibility of drivers to take extra caution for cyclists on the road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty callous to barely mention that he wanted to ride 20000 km around the country, and to just focus on interviewing a truck driver who wasn&rsquo;t even there without talking to the witnesses of the accident is hurtful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We request that you retract and amend the article, to do both Leif and his family justice.</p>
<p>Please make these amendments as soon as possible so the picture you have painted does not go public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have <a href="https://leifjustham.com/mediaqa.html">linked</a> the media statement we drafted last night for another journalist with q&amp;a&rsquo;s we provided that we provided when we talked on the phone. We would like to elaborate further if you are able.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have a responsibility as a journalist to tell the truth and use tragic events like this to unite people, especially since Leif&rsquo;s whole mission was to inspire people to use their power for good and save the earth as we know it.</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing back.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Brinly (on behalf of the Taylor/Justham family)</p>

the ABC made some minor changes but honestly the whole article is terrible.
