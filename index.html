<p>In honour of a wonderful human being, and a hero to those he met - <strong> Leif Indigo Justham</strong> - his family have created this website.</p>
<div>
<p>Leif believed we each have power to change the world for the better. He was driven by his convictions and his love of this earth and its creatures to bring awareness to issues causing climate change and habitat degradation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Tragically Leif was killed in an accident on Tuesday 6th April 2021 as he cycled across the Nullabor.</p>

If are touched by Leif's story the most important thing you can do is to <a title="marketforces super fund comparison" href="https://www.marketforces.org.au/campaigns/super/" target="_blank">switch</a> your superannuation fund to one that does not invest in fossil fuels or polluting industries. You can use the power of your money to make a difference. <p>
